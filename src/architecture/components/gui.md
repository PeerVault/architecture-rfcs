## PeerVault-GUI-Flutter (UI)

A Nice and smooth Desktop GUI to interact with the PeerVault daemon (service business logic)
in order to send command (HTTP) or receiving notifications (WEBSOCKET).

The Programming language chose are __flutter__ because it offers a native integration where the pixel can be painted
with a really nice declarative paradigm using Widget.
The Desktop support is a bit young but in active development.
