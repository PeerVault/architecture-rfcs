# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented and you need to write documentation about it for other to use it easily.
That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.
