> **PeerVault** is a peer-to-peer decentralized application used to share sensitive information with someone else identified by cryptographic keys. 
The Vault is yours, no server involved, **100% Open Source**.
Leverage from blockchain technology innovation such as libp2p and bip39 Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys.

# PeerVault Architecture & RFCs

Architecture and design Book implementation of the PeerVault.

This repository build a book available at [https://peervault.github.io/architecture-rfcs](https://peervault.github.io/architecture-rfcs).

## But, Why ?
Most people share sensible passwords and documents through email and insecure messaging platform.
Even in IT professional environment, it is common to exchange secrets without securing the exchange properly.
Who never shared a ssh key through slack?

## Values 
1. Must be decentralized (act as Server and Client at same time)
2. 1st Grade Security (encryption and tutti quanti)
3. Open Source (because strong security can only be built over time by the community)
4. Clean Architecture
