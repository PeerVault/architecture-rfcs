<h2><a class="header" href="#clean-architecture" id="clean-architecture">Clean Architecture</a></h2>
<p>Clean Architecture is a well-known design that promotes loosely coupled application components to have better 
control and flexibility over time on each part.</p>
<p>First, we have two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human Interface (GUI or CLI)</li>
<li>Business Logic (SERVICE)</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be kind of obvious for web developers but in the world of desktop applications it is not so much popular.
Split these two components gave us flexibility to choose different programming languages as well as ease the development 
of many Client UI without having to cope with all the complexity of business logic.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#peervault-service-daemon" id="peervault-service-daemon">PeerVault-Service (Daemon)</a></h2>
<p>All the business logic reside in the Service.</p>
<p>The Programming language chose are <strong>Go</strong>. Mainly because the underlying library <strong>libp2p</strong> have the most advanced 
support with Go and was the only way to make it work securely the Relay communication for passing through NAT.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/components//images/peervault-soft-archi.png" alt="PeerVault Daemon Architecture" /></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#layers" id="layers">Layers</a></h3>
<p>The service are build on top of 3 layers:</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#1-communication" id="1-communication">1. Communication</a></h4>
<p>The Blue layer represent the communication, internal with the GUI or external with other Peer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Local API: Expose HTTP API to manipulate the Vault create or restore Owner, create or share Secret</li>
<li>WebSocket Event: Instant notification to GUI when a new secret is shared by another Vault same or different Owner</li>
<li>Peer LibP2P: Enable secure p2p channel with other Vault through libp2p2 Relay to pass through NAT</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#2-domain" id="2-domain">2. Domain</a></h4>
<p>The Yellow layer represent the internal Domain abstraction</p>
<ul>
<li>Owner: Identity of the Vault Owner, contain Master Key, Device Key, QmPeerId.</li>
<li>Secret: Secret information, can have many format, Password, Document, Certificate, Private key...</li>
<li>Exposure: Expose secret publicly on the computer, when mounting SSH Private key</li>
<li>Backup: Able to export Vault DB encrypted, can only be restored by holding the Owner Master Key</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#3-persistence" id="3-persistence">3. Persistence</a></h4>
<p>The Red layer represent the persistent abstraction, we are using the bbolt key/value database</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#peervault-gui-flutter-ui" id="peervault-gui-flutter-ui">PeerVault-GUI-Flutter (UI)</a></h2>
<p>A Nice and smooth Desktop GUI to interact with the PeerVault daemon (service business logic)
in order to send command (HTTP) or receiving notifications (WEBSOCKET).</p>
<p>The Programming language chose are <strong>flutter</strong> because it offers a native integration where the pixel can be painted
with a really nice declarative paradigm using Widget.
The Desktop support is a bit young but in active development.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#peervault-cli-ui" id="peervault-cli-ui">PeerVault-CLI (UI)</a></h2>
<p>Able to communicate with the PeerVault Service API in the command line, 
useful for a programmatic system like a secrets manager for infrastructure as code.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#owner-keychain" id="owner-keychain">Owner keychain</a></h2>
<p>When a vault is created for the first time, the <code>Seed</code> will be generated and owner will be able to 
keep the Mnemonic phrase also known as <code>Paper key</code></p>
<p>Then a Master Key will be derivate from the Seed.
And for each device, a Child Key hardened will be generated using a random Uint32 index</p>
<p>Child Key will be used to create an identity for each Peers announced on the network.
Communication between peer will be encrypted using Child Key derivation.</p>
<p>The Relay will not be able to decrypt any exchange between peers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Owner identification is made using <strong>Master Public Key</strong></li>
<li>The Peer Identification is made using <strong>Child Public Key</strong></li>

<p>An RFC process front-loads the collaborative work of major changes or additions to an open-source project. 
That is, instead of waiting until a pull request arrives with lines of code changes, discussion begins early. 
Contributors are required to put in effort up-front to help others in the project community understand their proposed changes. 
The project's TSC and its extended developer community are invited to provide input within the structure of the RFC.</p>
<p>Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is generally a good idea to pursue feedback from 
other project developers beforehand, to ascertain that the RFC may be desirable; having a consistent impact 
on the project requires concerted effort toward consensus-building.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-to-propose-a-new-rfc" id="how-to-propose-a-new-rfc">How to propose a new RFC</a></h2>
<p>In order to ease the process, we have prepare a template that you can use to fill a proposal. </p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the file <code>0000-rfc-template.md</code> to <code>rfcs/0000-my-feature.md</code> 
(where &quot;my-feature&quot; is descriptive. don't assign an RFC number yet).</li>
<li>Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate lack of understanding of the design's impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be poorly-received.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise it in response.</li>
<li>At some point, a member of TSC (or other form of approval in this particular project) will approve or reject 
the proposal. It can also have a period for <code>final comment</code> (FCP) to notify that the process will end shortly.
FCP period is quiet, and the RFC is either merged or closed. However, sometimes substantial new arguments or ideas are raised, the FCP is canceled, and the RFC goes back into development mode.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-rfc-life-cycle" id="the-rfc-life-cycle">The RFC life-cycle</a></h2>
<p>Once an RFC has been approved, it will be merged and automatically published on the website.
Now that the RFC are active, it must be taken in the roadmap of the SDLC. In most of the case it will be implemented by the author of the RFC or any persons that seek interest to expedite the development of that RFC.</p>
